### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


# I'm Fishon!

I'm a Backend Developer with a passion for creating scalable and efficient backend systems.  

I have a good understanding of Python, Node Js, and PHP. I also understand how to use cloud technologies such AWS and Google Clouds. I'm an active member of the open-source community and have contributed to several open-source projects. 

I am always looking to learn and grow, and am eager to take on new challenges and make an impact at a dynamic and forward-thinking company. Feel free to reach out to me [HERE](mailto://amosfishon@outlook.com)
