### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


# I'm Fishon!

I'm a Backend Developer with 2+ years of experience in software development. I have a passion for creating scalable and efficient systems, and also consistently striving to improve performance and reliability of backend systems. 

I have a strong understanding of Python, Node Js, PHP, and Java. I also understand how to use cloud technologies such AWS and Google Clouds. I'm an active member of the open source community and have contributed to several projects. 

I am always looking to learn and grow, and am eager to take on new challenges and make an impact at a dynamic and forward-thinking company. Feel free to reach out to me to discuss potential opportunities and how I can contribute to your team's success.
