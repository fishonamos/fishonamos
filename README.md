### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a backend developer with a specialization in designing backend software architecture. I am proficient in Javascript, Python and PHP. 

Over the last few years, I have published several technical articles on different subjects ranging from security, programming, AI and databases. 

I am currently building Landver, a land information verification software, while working as the Technical Editor for FixRunner.

If you want to position your business for success using technology, you are free to reach out to me [HERE](mailto://amosfishon@outlook.com). 

Best,
Fishon Amos
